Use bootstrap-select/1.12.4

No problem with the code

Use bootstrap-select/1.13.10

The validation error doesn't show when data-live-search="true" option is used
and this because of not focussing on the element.

If you click on the last select, the message appear.

Validator worked perfect until my update to 1.13.10.
